However, there is some mismatch that need to be resolved. Notably, in `git-bug`, a person is:\n```go\ntype Person struct {\n\tName  string\n\tEmail string\n}\n```\nWhere for Github, an [actor](https://developer.github.com/v4/interface/actor/) is:\n```\navatarUrl (URI!)\nA URL pointing to the actor's public avatar.\n\nlogin (String!)\nThe username of the actor.\n\nresourcePath (URI!)\nThe HTTP path for this actor.\n\nurl (URI!)\nThe HTTP URL for this actor.\n```","files":null}]}
