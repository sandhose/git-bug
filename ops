Priority usually expresses the importance of getting a bug fixes/an issue closed, often from the maintainer's point of view. Severity expresses the impact of a bug/issue (e.g. is it only inconvenient, does the application crash or does it corrupt data). Both are often used for sorting issues and deciding what to tackle next.\n\nOT: there are alternatives to maintainer-/user-set priority, e.g. \"[user pain](http://www.lostgarden.com/2008/05/improving-bug-triage-with-user-pain.html)\".","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"name":"Michael Muré","email":"","login":"MichaelMure","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/294669?v=4"},"timestamp":1542083976,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzODEzMzQxOQ=="},"message":"Sorry I wasn't clear.\n\nWhat I mean is that even if we say the consensus is that it make sense to have this feature (and many bug tracker didn't go that way), it's still something that can be done many ways.
