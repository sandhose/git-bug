Here is a sample of questions that I have:\n\n## Actor\n\n- what properties (name, email, login, id, avatar ...) does the bug-tracker know about an actor ?\n- what is mandatory, what is optional ?\n\n## Bug's state\n\n- how do they model a state ? Is it an fixed set of state, or is it extensible? configurable ?\n- how do they model the transition between these states ?\n\n## missing features in git-bug\n\n- For instance, Github support reactions to messages with a set of emojis. What other bug-tracker support that ?\n- What other important features other bug-trackers have ? Is there a common ground ? Are they incompatible ?\n\nWith the attention git-bug got lately, hopefully we can collaborate and fill the blanks together in a shared spreadsheet.","files":null},{"type":5,"author":{"name":"Michael Muré","email":"","login":"MichaelMure","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/294669?v=4"},"timestamp":1534943004,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDE4MDI1OTAyMTc="},"added":["help wanted"],"removed":null},{"type":3,"author":{"name":"Jed Fox","email":"git@twopointzero.us","login":"j-f1","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/25517624?v=4"},"timestamp":1534944616,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxNTAzMjA3NA==","github-url":"https://github.com/MichaelMure/git-bug/issues/30#issuecomment-415032074"},"message":"Things in *italics* are missing features.\n\n# GitHub\n\nActor: name (not shown by default), *username/login*, email (not shown by default, but may be useful for associating the user with commits), *avatar*\nState: Open/closed, *locked/unlocked*, *optional lock reason*, *assignees* (≤ 10)\nCategorization: labels (name + description + *color*), *milestone* (1 per issue), *projects* (multiple, can place issues in different columns)","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"name":"Michael Muré","email":"","login":"MichaelMure","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/294669?v=4"},"timestamp":1534948272,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxNTA1MjgzMg==","github-url":"https://github.com/MichaelMure/git-bug/issues/30#issuecomment-415052832"},"message":"@j-f1 thank you !\n\nI started a shared spreadsheet, could move over there ? https://framacalc.org/bugtracker\n\nSorry you are way too fast ;)","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"name":"Michael Muré","email":"","login":"MichaelMure","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/294669?v=4"},"timestamp":1534948865,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxNTA1NjM4NQ=="},"message":"Also we should stay with facts only for now imho, we will decide from that what feature we can and should support, and how.","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"name":"Julian Ganz","email":"","login":"neithernut","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/6747556?v=4"},"timestamp":1534949569,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxNTA2MDUxNg=="},"message":"Maybe also have a look at https://dist-bugs.branchable.com/software/ (in theory, this link should have reached you already via various channels)","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"name":"Michael Muré","email":"","login":"MichaelMure","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/294669?v=4"},"timestamp":1534950068,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxNTA2MzcxNA=="},"message":"@neithernut yes thanks I saw it.
