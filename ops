Alternatively, since Markdown tries to be human-readable, it could be output as-is on terminals. Support could eventually be added to style bold/italics as they’re supposed to be styled while fading out the `*`/`_` delimiters. Similar things could be done for inline code (fade out the `` ` ``) and code blocks (fade out the ` ``` ` and syntax-highlight the code based on the language tag).","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"name":"","email":"andy@r210.com","login":"andyl","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/90030?v=4"},"timestamp":1536945528,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyMTQyNjM2NQ=="},"message":"We would also like Markdown comments.  \n\nFor extra credit: it would be nice to have a markdown 'templating' way to dynamically render meta-data variables (like $issue_id, $issue_labels, $issue_title, $issue_status).\n\n    ![Status PNG](http://mywebhost/status.png?issue_id={{$issue_id}}\u0026issue_status={{$issue_status}})","files":null}]}
