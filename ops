A good example would be the set of labels: out of the box, any label is valid. Once a config is defined, only those are accepted as valid.\n- if there is a need to do an opinionated default choice, it should favor a small project/team. Bigger team will have the time to tweak git-bug as needed.\n- user should not have to know how and where the configuration is stored to manage it.
