Having this kind of feature would require git-bug to track changes in the normal branches and edit bugs accordingly.\n\nMaybe git-bug could install a hook to spy on the normal workflow and trigger these changes ?

I'll dig more into the documentation.\n\nInstalling a commit hook sounds like a good idea to me. I'm okay with some of these events being missed if contributors don't have git-bug installed because I feel like even if teams don't buy into this fully, it would still be helpful to those on the team that are using it (especially if conveniences are added like the automatic bug closing feature I mentioned). \n\nThis opens up the opportunity for a lot of features though and it's probably a good idea to think about an extension/plugin system early on so that the project is less burdensome to maintain. Personally, I am really excited about the idea of using a git-bug extension to generate a CHANGELOG because I think it would be a lot smoother than alternatives like commitizen.","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"name":"Edgar Hipp","email":"contact@javascript-ninja.fr","login":"edi9999","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/2071336?v=4"},"timestamp":1534683449,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxNDEyNjA1Mg=="},"message":"This could be both a git hook to \"notify\" git-bug of the commit-message, and git-bug could also be automatically at startup check whether all commit messages have already been parsed, and then apply the \"actions\" starting from the oldest \"unseen\" commit","files":null}]}
