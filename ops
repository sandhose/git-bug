Please allow me to start with our situation with git-bug:\n\nI am imagining git-bug to become the source of truth for bug/track/issue threads and communications internally at our company.\n\nMoreover, I found the idea of storing text-based information as git objects particular interesting in use cases where close interaction with git commits/branches/tags is required. This could include gerrit, git-bug, jenkins, kubernetes, etc. (details omitted for brevity, would like to expatiate upon request).\n\nCurrently two main blockers with going all-in with git-bug:\n  1. **Lack of formatting and linting tools such as formatters, linters, and templates**. Otherwise we have no guarantee \n  2. **git-bug commits got garbage collected on GitHub**. We host our own internal git server. Either way, there has to be some level of support from the server side to correctly identify commit objects managed by git-bug and not to delete them.\n\nI like the idea of using command line + git objects to share and track bugs and issues.  As of this writing, we are ready to use `git-bug` (already secretly deployed to every developer's desktop under `$PATH`), provided that the above two issues are resolved.","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"name":"Michael Muré","email":"","login":"MichaelMure","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/294669?v=4"},"timestamp":1540746365,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzMzcyMzAwMw=="},"message":"\u003e git-bug commits got garbage collected on GitHub\n\nCould you detail that ?\n\n\u003e I like the idea of using command line + git objects to share and track bugs and issues.

That said, please be careful as it will be most likely more incompatible changes in the data model before git-bug reach version 1.0 (mainly https://github.com/MichaelMure/git-bug/issues/55).","files":null}]}
